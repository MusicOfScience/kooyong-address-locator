# 🗺️ Kooyong Boundary Locator

This app displays the 2025 Kooyong electoral boundary and lets you:
- Check if an address falls inside Kooyong
- View a stylised map with road overlays
- Download the boundary map

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Visit the deployed app: [Streamlit Cloud](https://streamlit.io/cloud)
2. Type any Victorian address (e.g., "385 Toorak Rd, South Yarra")
3. The map updates and confirms in/out status.

## 🗂️ Update the Boundary

To update for future redistributions:
1. Replace `data/Vic-october-2024-esri.zip` with a new AEC ZIP file
2. Redeploy the app — Streamlit will auto-refresh
